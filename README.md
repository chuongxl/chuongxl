### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Chuong Nguyen. I'm an experienced software developer with more than 14 years of experience in the industry. I currently work as a Solution Architect, where I'm responsible for developing technical solutions to help clients solve their business problems.
- I have a strong background in C#, .NET, and web development, as well as a deep understanding of software architecture and design patterns. I'm also proficient in many other technologies, such as Java Spring framework, reactjs, nextjs, SQL Server, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, and Azure. I'm an expert at writing clean code that is easy to maintain and understand. I'm passionate about building high-quality software solutions and take pride in my work. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and love experimenting with different technologies to find the best solution for each problem.
- Besides my professional work, I am deeply passionate about both the tech community and education. This passion has driven me to create an inclusive platform(itschool.dev), dedicated to education. Utilizing cutting-edge AI technology, our platform aims to assist students and professionals alike in broadening their knowledge and refining their skills. If you're interested in joining or discussing this project, please feel free to reach out to me via email at itschoolvndev@gmail.com or alex.nguyenxl@gmail.com."
