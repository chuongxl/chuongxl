### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m Alex Nguyen, and Iâ€™m excited to share a bit about myself. With over 14 years in software development, I currently work as a Solution Architect, where I love crafting technical solutions that help clients tackle their business challenges.

My expertise lies in C#, .NET, and web development, along with a solid grasp of software architecture and design patterns. I also enjoy working with a variety of other technologies, including the Java Spring framework, React, Next.js, SQL Server, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, and Azure. Writing clean, maintainable code is a passion of mine, and I take great pride in delivering high-quality software solutions. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies to find the best fit for each project.

Outside of my professional work, Iâ€™m deeply committed to the tech community and education. Thatâ€™s why I created itschool.dev, an inclusive platform aimed at empowering students and professionals through cutting-edge AI technology. Our goal is to help everyone expand their knowledge and sharpen their skills.

If youâ€™re interested in joining our mission or just want to chat about the project, feel free to reach out at itschoolvndev@gmail.com or alex.nguyenxl@gmail.com. Iâ€™d love to connect!
